# Logistic-Regression-Loss-Cost-Function-Implementation
his repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing the loss and cost functions for logistic regression using Python and NumPy, as part of Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialization (Course 1, Week 3 Lab).
🧠 Overview
This project focuses on understanding and implementing the logistic regression loss and cost functions using NumPy. It is part of the practical labs from the "Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification" course by Andrew Ng on Coursera.
